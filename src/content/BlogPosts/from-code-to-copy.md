# The Problem with Being Too Technical

For years, I lived in the land of pull requests, API endpoints, and cloud infrastructure. I was comfortable there. I knew my way around Terraform, Docker, and Kubernetes. I'd provisioned plenty of resources on AWS and GCP. Life was good.

But something was missing.

I realized I was operating in a bubble—the technical backend of companies. I could build the engine, but couldn't sell the car. I understood databases but not customers. I could write code that scaled, but not words that converted.

That's when I made a decision that confused most of my engineer friends: I decided to pivot into technical copywriting for SaaS companies.

## Why Leave the Comfort Zone?

The answer is simple: **I wanted to build my own SaaS, and I knew I couldn't do it with just engineering skills.**

You can have the most elegant codebase in the world, but if you can't communicate your value proposition, you're dead in the water. You can architect a beautiful distributed system, but if your landing page confuses visitors, nobody will sign up.

I'd seen it happen too many times—brilliant technical founders who couldn't articulate what their product did, who confused features with benefits, who thought "built with microservices" was a selling point to non-technical buyers.

I didn't want to be that founder.

## The Breadth Philosophy

This wasn't my first pivot. I've always been a breadth-over-depth kind of person. I'm a polyglot developer who's bounced between languages and frameworks for twenty years. I've worked in six cities, across multiple industries. I value understanding the whole system, not just mastering one corner of it.

So when I decided I wanted to eventually build and grow my own SaaS, I knew I needed to understand the full spectrum of what that meant. Not just the engineering side, but the marketing side. The customer-facing side. The frontend of building a company.

## What I Actually Did

For about three years, I immersed myself in crafting copy for SaaS companies:

- **Website copy**: Landing pages, feature pages, about pages. Learning how to communicate technical value to non-technical audiences.
- **Technical content**: Blog posts, whitepapers, case studies. Understanding how to educate prospects while building trust and authority.
- **Documentation**: User guides, API docs, tutorials. Discovering the sweet spot between technical accuracy and user-friendliness.

The technical background helped. I could interview engineers, understand complex architectures, and translate jargon into something clearer. I wasn't just a copywriter—I was a technical copywriter who could bridge the gap between engineering and marketing.

Those three years taught me more about building products than any engineering role ever did. I learned to think in terms of value propositions, customer pain points, and conversion funnels. I discovered that clarity beats cleverness, and that the best technical writing makes complexity disappear.

## What I Learned

### 1. **Engineers and Marketers Speak Different Languages**

Engineers optimize for accuracy and completeness. Marketers optimize for clarity and conversion. Both are right. Both are wrong. The magic happens when you can speak both languages and find the middle ground.

### 2. **Customers Don't Care About Your Tech Stack**

Nobody wakes up wanting to use your API. They wake up with a problem. Your job is to show them how you solve that problem—not to impress them with your architectural decisions.

### 3. **Words Scale Differently Than Code**

Code scales through abstraction and automation. Words scale through clarity and resonance. A single well-crafted message can convert thousands of visitors. A confusing one can kill a product.

### 4. **Marketing Isn't Black Magic**

As engineers, we often treat marketing like it's some dark art. It's not. It's just another system to understand. There are patterns, frameworks, and best practices—just like in software engineering.

### 5. **Being Close to Customers Changes Everything**

Writing for customers forced me to think about their pain points, their objections, their language. It gave me empathy I never had when I was three layers of abstraction away, writing backend services.

## The Real Goal

This wasn't just about becoming a better writer. It was about becoming a better founder.

I wanted to know what it felt like to:

- Sit in customer discovery calls
- Analyze conversion funnels
- A/B test landing page copy
- Optimize for search intent
- Craft positioning that resonates

I wanted to experience the real problems of growing a company—the ones that exist before product-market fit, the ones that you can't solve with better code.

## Where This Led Me

That three-year copywriting detour turned out to be anything but a detour. It became a bridge.

The experience led me to own API documentation at Palo Alto Networks—a role that sits at the intersection of engineering and communication. I could work with developers on endpoints and authentication schemes, then write docs that made those concepts more accessible.

Now I'm in a unique position. I can:

- Build the product (engineering)
- Explain the product (copywriting)
- Document the product (technical writing)
- Position the product (marketing)

More importantly, I understand how all these pieces fit together. I've seen the full spectrum, from code to customer. I know where the gaps are, where communication breaks down, where technical founders struggle.

When I build my own SaaS (and I will), I won't just be a technical founder who outsources marketing. I'll be a founder who understands the whole system.

## The Broader Lesson

This pivot taught me something valuable: **the best founders are T-shaped people**—deep in one area, broad across many.

You don't need to be the world's best engineer. You don't need to be the world's best marketer. But you need to understand how the pieces connect.

That's what I'm building toward. Not expertise in isolation, but systems thinking across domains.

## What's Next?

I'm still writing. Still building. Still exploring.

The copywriting years didn't replace my engineering skills—they augmented them. I'm still hacking on Web3 projects, winning hackathons, deploying infrastructure. But now I have another tool in the toolbox. Another language in the polyglot repertoire.

Those three years weren't a career change. They were an expansion pack.

Because when the time comes to launch my own SaaS, I won't just know how to build it.

I'll know how to sell it too.

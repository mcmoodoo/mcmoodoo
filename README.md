        1. Maintained API reference documentation. Curated, verified, and released documentation for more than forty unique APIs, each containing between ten and eighty endpoints. Striving for readability and overall clarity of the API reference doc site, I’ve been regularly updating it with the most up-to-date OpenAPI specification files gleaned from the development teams using a docs-as-code workflow.

        2. I have transitioned the entire API reference site to its new home at https://pan.dev with an enhanced user interface and more robust search indexing capabilities.

        3. I have validated, refined, and propagated the latest updates from dev teams to the tech docs site by:
         - adding and refining swagger annotations within each repository’s source code
         - pushing it through the CI/CD pipeline and obtaining the generated OpenAPI specification file
         - updating the API reference doc repo with an updated OpenAPI spec file
         - verifying and creating a PR1. Maintained API reference documentation.
